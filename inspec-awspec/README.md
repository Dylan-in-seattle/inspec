# InSpec - awspec Adapter

## EXPERIMENTAL - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

## Overview

This InSpec Resource Pack provides all of the AWS resources supported by the [awspec project](https://github.com/k1LoW/awspec)

The motivation is that auditing AWS is a vast undertaking. It does not make sense to duplicate that effort.  InSpec also has a much broader mission than auditing AWS; InSpec also targets operating systems, other cloud providers, container orchestrators, and many other things.

## Installation

TODO: You MUST install the `awspec` gem manually to a location that InSpec can find.

## Limitations

 * Gem installation could be less awful
